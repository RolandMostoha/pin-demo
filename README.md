# PIN Demo
Demo project for the Effective Automated Testing presentation at the [Google I/O 2017 Extended event](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Budapest/events/238509776/).

I've separated the different states of the application by branches to follow the presentation's topics:

1. [Master](https://github.com/RolandMostoha/pin-demo/tree/master): Initial state with UI tests
2. [Step 1](https://github.com/RolandMostoha/pin-demo/tree/step-1-hermetic-testing): Hermetic testing, DIP + DI
3. [Step 2](https://github.com/RolandMostoha/pin-demo/tree/step-2-MVP): Decoupling Android, MVP, Unit tests
4. [Step 3](https://github.com/RolandMostoha/pin-demo/tree/step-3-JUnit5): Upgrade to JUnit 5
